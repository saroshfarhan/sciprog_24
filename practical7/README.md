## Practical 7

This week we studied ho to find the e value using the series expansion.
The code for that is in finde.c file.

We also learned about pointers and dynamic memory allocation and the code for this is in pointers.c

### Outputs
note - (since sciprog was not available, I have attached local outputs)

**Output for finde.c**
```shell
saroshfarhan@Saroshs-MacBook-Air practical7 % ./e                 
Please enter the order you wish to use
