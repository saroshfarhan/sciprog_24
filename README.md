# Git Assigment practicals

* Author: Sarosh Farhan

This repository contains practicals of every week of study material that we covered in our lectures.
All the files were added once the practicals were finished and I was able to cross check my code with the instructor's code and logic.<br>
All answers are verfied on sciprog and outputs added in the respective `README.md` files in respective week's folders.
<br>
Proper git workflow was maintained throughout the course and each practical was added with its own branch and a PR was raised and merged to main branch to emulate production level version control.<br>
